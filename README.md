### Software installation guide

**for the course ‘Fundamentals of Programming’**

- Step 1a: install [R +
  Rstudio](https://bookdown.org/brry/course/install.html), including the
  Rdata settings
- Step 1b: check if R is on the PATH (locations where executables are
  found):  
- in your OS, search (Windows: `Windows key`. Mac: `CMD` + `SPACE`) for
  “**Terminal**” (a.k.a console, shell, bash, cmd)  
- run the command `R` (Windows Powershell: `R.exe`) - check if it’s a
  recent version, quit with `q("no")`
- if R is not found / recognized, add it to the *system* (not user) PATH
